🩺 Disease Predictor

📌 Overview
The Disease Predictor is a machine learning project that aims to predict possible diseases based on patient health records and symptoms.  
Using classification algorithms, the model analyzes medical attributes and generates predictions that can assist in early healthcare diagnostics.

This project is implemented in Python using Jupyter/Colab Notebooks, and leverages popular ML libraries for data handling, training, and evaluation.

🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of healthcare datasets  
- Training machine learning models for disease prediction  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics  
- Exporting trained models for reuse (pkl files via Joblib)  
- Easy-to-use notebook interface for step-by-step execution  

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy, Pandas → Data handling  
- Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn → Data visualization  
- Joblib → Model saving and loading

⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/Darpan01Tech/Disease_Pred.git  
   cd Disease_Pred  
2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment.  
3. Install dependencies:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  

▶️ Usage
1. Open the notebook (Disease_Pred.ipynb) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells step by step.  
3. Train the model and evaluate results.  
4. (Optional) Use the saved pkl model for deployment in other applications.  

📊 Example Workflow
1. Load dataset  
2. Preprocess data (cleaning, encoding, scaling)  
3. Train ML model (Random Forest / Logistic Regression / etc.)  
4. Evaluate accuracy and confusion matrix  
5. Save trained model for later usage  

🔮 Future Improvements
- Build a Streamlit web app for interactive predictions  
- Expand dataset for more disease categories  
- Add Deep Learning models for higher accuracy  
- Deploy model on Cloud (AWS / GCP / Heroku)
